<h2 align="left">Project 2: E-Commerce Furniture Store</h2>

###

<p align="left">Minimal and decent-looking E-commerce Furniture Store made by using React JS and Bootstrap. It is a single-page application and the whole code is neatly broken down into the folders and components so almost every part of the app is reusable. The app contains a fully working cart system with so many other functionalities like real-time product search, filtering products by categories, showing related products, and navigating from one product to another within the product page. A 404 page has also been integrated for the broken and undefined URLs.</p>

<h2 align="left">Project 4: Hotelbnb</h2>

###

<p align="left">Hotelbnb is a comprehensive hotel booking system developed using the MERN stack. This project offers a range of features including room availability checks, reservations, and dynamic room searches based on check-in and checkout dates as well as the number of occupants. The system facilitates secure payment transactions through Stripe, with bookings expiring if payment is not completed within 15 minutes. Other than MERN some technologies have been used like JWT for secure authentication and authorization, Ant design for some complex design components, Chart Js for graphical representation of booking statistics on the admin dashboard, and Day Js for managing check-in and check-out dates.</p>
