<h2 align="left">Project 1: Coffee Shop Website</h2>

###

<p align="left">Multi-Page beautifully designed Coffee shop website made in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. The website shows the better customer experience they are providing by enabling them to order through the website before they reach the shop. Email Js (Client Side Mailing Javascript Library) has been used to get the details from the contact and placing order form on the email.</p>
